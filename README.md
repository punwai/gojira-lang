## Gojira Lang
This repo includes Gojira lang. An interpreted language that I developed in Rust. The language is dynamically typed and implements garbage collection. I became pretty curious about programming languages after playing around with Move during my time working on Sui - so I'll just be doing this as a learning exercise.

Lets see if I can learn about programming languages and create one in a weekend!
